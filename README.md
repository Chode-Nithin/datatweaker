# Data Explorer App README

## Overview

The Data Explorer App is a user-friendly web application designed for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing tasks. It allows users to upload CSV files and generates detailed reports using y_data profiling, enabling users to gain insights into their data, identify missing values, visualize data distributions, and more. The app offers various visualization options such as scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, count plots, histograms, box plots, heatmaps, and pair plots, allowing users to explore relationships between different attributes in their dataset. Additionally, users can preprocess their data by replacing missing values, converting categorical data to numerical using label encoding, and removing duplicate values.

## Features

- **Upload CSV Data:** Users can upload their CSV files directly to the app.
- **Data Visualization:** The app provides a range of visualization options to explore data distributions and relationships.
- **EDA Report:** Users can generate detailed Exploratory Data Analysis reports to gain insights into their data.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Users can preprocess their data by replacing missing values, converting categorical data to numerical, and removing duplicate values.
- **Download Reports:** Users can download the EDA report and the processed CSV file for further analysis.

## Libraries Used

- **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy:** For numerical computing.
- **matplotlib:** For data visualization.
- **seaborn:** For statistical data visualization.
- **streamlit:** For creating interactive web applications.
- **sklearn:** For preprocessing data using label encoding.
- **ydata_profiling:** For generating detailed data profiling reports.

## How to Use

1. **Upload Data:** Click on the "Upload your CSV file" button in the sidebar to upload your CSV file.
2. **Visualize Data:** Select the desired visualization options from the sidebar to explore your data visually.
3. **Generate EDA Report:** Check the "Show Report" checkbox to generate a detailed EDA report.
4. **Data Transformation:** Use the checkboxes in the "Data Transformation Options" section to preprocess your data.
5. **Download Processed Data:** Click on the "Download Processed DataFrame as CSV" button to download the processed CSV file.

## Notes
